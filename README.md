## Description
The project explores the lifecycle of a software engineer during their time at Planview. Our goal is to provide a visualization of data of the types of tickets a developer has completed, in an fun and interesting way. We provide data on one's work and a message board to allow other users to leave any final messages on the developer's departure.
